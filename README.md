About the Project/Project Title
Grazio Salvare Animal Shelters

Motivation
This project built a functional, web based dashboard for Grazio Salvare Animal Shelters so that they may monitor the database of animals that are currently at the Austin location. 

Getting Started / Installation
To use this software the following tools must be installed:
•	Python 3.6
•	Pymongo 4.2: link
•	MongoDB 4.2: link
•	Plotly Dash: link
•	Dash Leaflet: link
•	Data available in a Mongo database collection, see example on importing a CSV
•	User account with read/write permissions


Usage
The Animal Shelters Application uses CRUD functions integrated with python’s library ‘pymongo’ to interact with the ‘AAC’ database in MongoDB. This function is made by a mongoclient set to LocalHost machine running the server. Listed is the AAC database and passed parameters of username & password for authentication. The CRUD Python Module is designed to manipulate all data in any way in a database. The four major pillars of data manipulation are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
Jupyter dash is then used to create a user interface.
